#+TITLE: My Dotfiles
#+AUTHOR: Arya K
* What does this contain
This contains my
- Emacs config
- Sway Config
- Wofi Config
- Mako Config
- Waybar Config
- Swaylock Config
- BASH Config
* Quick Note
I had a repo with my old dotfiles which has now been archived due to me using very bad git practices.
It is at https://github.com/gi-yt/dotfiles-old
* How to install
This config uses stow.

So after installing stow, you can do ~stow .~ in the ~/dotfiles directory which would symlink my configs to the right place in your home directory.

If you have the deps everything will work out of the box other than emacs.

For emacs you also need to execute these commands

~M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts ;; For all-the-icons fonts~

~M-x vterm-module-compile ;; For vterm~

~M-x emojify-mode ;; For emoji support~

and you also need to get [[https://github.com/emacs-eaf/emacs-application-framework][eaf]] from github
* Dependencies
I use many small scripts.

Most of those are in the scripts directory of the specific config.

For the rest I will list them here
** Sway
- [[https://swaywm.org][sway]] (The window manager itself)
- [[https://wayland.freedesktop.org/xserver.html][XWayland]] (Xorg apps compatibility)

You will also need pipewire and xdg-desktop-portal for screensharing.

If you use systemd, no configuration is needed after install as my autostart will take care of everything.

Without systemd its a pain TBH.
